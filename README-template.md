## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Useful resources

- [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me to properly center the component in the page. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Centering in CSS](https://moderncss.dev/complete-guide-to-centering-in-css/#xy-centering-for-block-elements) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand about centering in CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to give a shout-out to a helpful individual [Abdul Khalid](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/0xAbdulKhalid) who provided me with some valuable tips on web development. Abdul suggested that rather than using margin and padding to center components both horizontally and vertically, I should use Flexbox or Grid layout. This technique dynamically centers the component at all states and is considered best practice for web development. I greatly appreciate his input, as it has helped me improve my skills in this area.
